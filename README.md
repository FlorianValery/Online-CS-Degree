## Introduction to Computer Science

**CS50**, like a lot of other people before me, changed my life and made me love computer science. David J. Malan introduces Computer Science to begginers in an amazing and challenging way. Taking this course if you have never writen a line of code before can be
tough, really tough, but completing each week's assignment can feel really rewarding. <br> <br>
The content of the course itself is really complete: from how to use a basic command-line interface to fully implementing a complexe stock related website through explaining how simple algorithms work, CS50 is a incredible class to give you a taste of what Computer Science is.
This class also requires a [Final Project](https://github.com/FlorianValery/MyOSU).

- [CS50 Finance](https://finance.cs50.net/) : This is the main imposed project throughout the course. The goal is to implement a fully functional website where we can buy and sell stocks, using real live data.
- [Final Project](https://github.com/FlorianValery/MyOSU) : Final project of our choice where we a free to build anything we want, as long as it draws upon CS50’s lessons. I decided to implement a fictive e-learning platform.

## Programming

Because I have been spending a lot of my time working on side projects using Python as the main programming language, I thought that it was also important to spend some time learning an other one. The [Object Oriented Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming) from UC San Diego & Duke was perfect, as it's also focusing Object Oriented Programming.

The goal is to implement a 'a smart text editor/processor that incorporates “intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct'.
