# Overview

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using online materials.
It's not merely for career training or professional development.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

## Introduction to Computer Science

**CS50**, like a lot of other people, changed my life and made me love computer science. David J. Malan introduces Computer Science
to begginers in an amazing and challenging way. Taking this course if you have never writen a line of code before can be
tough, really tough, completing each week's assignment can feel really rewarding. 
The content of the course itself is really complete: from how to use a basic command-line interface to how to implement a complexe stock related
website through explaining how simple algorithms work, CS50 is a incredible class to give you a taste of what Computer Science is.

#### Readings
- **Required** to learn about monads, laziness, purity: [Learn You a Haskell for a Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
  - **Note**: probably the best resource to learn Haskell: [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/) `paid`
- **Required**, to learn about logic programming, backtracking, unification: [Learn Prolog Now!](http://lpn.swi-prolog.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=top)

### Core math

`linear transformations`
`matrices`
`vectors`

<sup>**1**</sup>: Students struggling with MIT Math for CS can consider taking the [Discrete Mathematics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics) first.
It is more interactive but less comprehensive, and it costs money to unlock full interactivity.
