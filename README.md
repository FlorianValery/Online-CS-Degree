# Overview

At the end of 2018, I decided to fully commit myself towards Computer Science. I hold a bachelor degree in Foreign Languages (English & Chinese), so the transition was not easy. My goal was to obtain the equivalent of a real computer science BA through MOOCs and other online courses, ultimately to be able to apply for master degrees. 
Here is the record of the courses I have taken, and some useful information about them (duration, knowledge acquired etc).

## Introduction to Computer Science

**CS50**, like a lot of other people before me, changed my life and made me love computer science. David J. Malan introduces Computer Science to begginers in an amazing and challenging way. Taking this course if you have never writen a line of code before can be
tough, really tough, but completing each week's assignment can feel really rewarding. <br> <br>
The content of the course itself is really complete: from how to use a basic command-line interface to fully implementing a complexe stock related website through explaining how simple algorithms work, CS50 is a incredible class to give you a taste of what Computer Science is.
This class also requires a [Final Project](https://github.com/FlorianValery/MyOSU).

## Programming

Because I have been spending a lot of my time working on side projects using Python as the main programming language, I thought that it was also important to spend some time learning an other one. The [Object Oriented Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming) from UC San Diego & Duke was perfect, as it's also focusing Object Oriented Programming.

## Math

Coming from a non-technical degree, having a strong foundation in Maths was really important. Therefore, I decided to start over from Pre-algebra. Khan Academy was really useful for this.
When it comes to Linear ALgebra and Discrete Maths - which are probably the most important fields for CS students , the University of Texas and UC San Diego's respective courses are great and well explained

## Systems

Nand2tetris is THE reference when it comes to understanding computer hardware. This class literaly made me start with logic gates, the most primitive components that you can find in a computer, through building a complete computing system which is able to play Tetris. This course was extremely tough, but I now have a deeper understanding about how computers work.

## Theory

Tim Roughgarden's course at Stanford University is probably the most complex course about Data Structures and Algorithms. Can be really challenging, but rewarding as well.
